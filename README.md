Leveraging single-sided liquidity on CLMM DEX's for better swaps with no slippage, Aperture brings you the first-ever revenue-generating limit (and range) orders for trading token on Polygon! Just pick a price target or select a range -- when your order gets filled, you get the tokens at your ideal price, and earn extra trade fees through the process!
